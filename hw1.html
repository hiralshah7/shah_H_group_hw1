        <h2>Hobbies: watching movies, listening to music</h2>
        <p>
            I like watching movies and listening to music when I have free time.<br>
            The movie genre that I love is action and fantasy so, my favorite movie is “Along with the gods” which is a South Korean fantasy action movie.<br>
            Also, I always listen to music whenever I do something boring.<br> 
            I love listening to EDM, Pop, and rap music.

        <h2>Why Choose Canada</h2>
        <p>
            When I was young, I wanted to go and live in other countries to experience a variety of cultures and meet various people.<br>
            Also, I wanted to learn both design and coding skills.<br>
            I realized that I could do everything I wanted at Fanshawe College, so I decided to study abroad.<br> 
            Every study that I’m learning here is new for me, so I may not keep up well, but I still want to do my best to learn.
