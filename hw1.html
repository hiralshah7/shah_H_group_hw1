        <h2>Hobbies: watching movies, listening to music</h2>
        <p>
            I like watching movies and listening to music when I have free time.<br>
            The movie genre that I love is action and fantasy so, my favorite movie is “Along with the gods” which is a South Korean fantasy action movie.<br>
            Also, I always listen to music whenever I do something boring.<br> 
            I love listening to EDM, Pop, and rap music.

        <h2>Why Choose Canada</h2>
        <p>
            When I was young, I wanted to go and live in other countries to experience a variety of cultures and meet various people.<br>
            Also, I wanted to learn both design and coding skills.<br>
            I realized that I could do everything I wanted at Fanshawe College, so I decided to study abroad.<br> 
            Every study that I’m learning here is new for me, so I may not keep up well, but I still want to do my best to learn.

            <h2>Likes: Watching anime, and reading manga. Playing video games. Doing 3D still posters.</h2>
            <h2>Specific Hobbies:</h2>
            <p> 
                With anime, being more specific I love Isekai's, what that means is going to different worlds and having an exploration in said world. Having an absolute blast in there.
                For Manga, I love following the roles of villains and villianess as they try to reclaim their honor, try to live a subtle life after doing such horrific acts as the baddie. 
                The video games I love to play would be Battle Royales such as Apex Legends, Bloodhunt and Hunt: Showdown currently, moving into Moba's such as SMITE and mobile games like Raid: Shadow Legends.

                <h2>About Me!!!</h2>
                <p>
                    I am a First Nation Women who loves to be on my computer all day long. I am what some people call a weeb or an otaku. I used to play ESports but quickly got burnt out when it was day-in day-out work due to the pandemic. Just the same games over and over again.
                    I am proud about being Ojib-cree. I am the 7th oldest out of 15 children. All the same mom but different dads. I used to live in North Western Ontario so I know cold, coldest it has ever been up there was -55c. I wish it got as much snow down here and it does up there. I love Halloween because it would be my birthday and then 6 days later I get a ton of candy.
