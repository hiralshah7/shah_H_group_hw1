Hobbies
I like watching movies and listening to music when I have free time. The movie genre that I love is action and fantasy so, my favorite movie is “Along with the gods” which is a South Korean fantasy action movie. Also, I always listen to music whenever I do something boring. I love listening to EDM, Pop, and rap music.
