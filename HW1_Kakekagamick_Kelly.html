    <h1>My Introduction to the Professer</h1>
    <h2>Name: Kelly Kakekagumick or Gumbawa Mashiit Migisi</h2>
    <h2>Birthday: October 25th, 2001</h2>
    <h2>Likes: Watching anime, and reading manga. Playing video games. Doing 3D still posters.
    <h2>Specific Hobbies:</h2>
    <p> 
        With anime, being more specific I love Isekai's, what that means is going to different worlds and having an exploration in said world. Having an absolute blast in there.
        For Manga, I love following the roles of villains and villianess as they try to reclaim their honor, try to live a subtle life after doing such horrific acts as the baddie. 
        The video games I love to play would be Battle Royales such as Apex Legends, Bloodhunt and Hunt: Showdown currently, moving into Moba's such as SMITE and mobile games like Raid: Shadow Legends.

        <h2>About Me!!!</h2>
        <p>
            I am a First Nation Women who loves to be on my computer all day long. I am what some people call a weeb or an otaku. I used to play ESports but quickly got burnt out when it was day-in day-out work due to the pandemic. Just the same games over and over again.
            I am proud about being Ojib-cree. I am the 7th oldest out of 15 children. All the same mom but different dads. I used to live in North Western Ontario so I know cold, coldest it has ever been up there was -55c. I wish it got as much snow down here and it does up there. I love Halloween because it would be my birthday and then 6 days later I get a ton of candy.
